# Some info about the code

Please know that I have not used Redux in this test as the tasks were very simple and there was no props drilling involved.
Also I have used localstorage to presist the states (sace values after reload). I know there is a method to do this with redux presist but since I haven't used redux, localstorage was a good choice for this operation
